# About Me

In addition to being a leader, dad, uncle, & data guy, I am a data & technology 
professional with real-world experience in data science, data analytics, data 
engineering, fraud detection, risk modeling, building and maintaining data teams, 
project management, sales, consulting, and teaching. 

My passion for data and statistics has inspired me to become an Adjunct 
Professor of Statistics, which has improved my ability to explain complex 
subjects to all levels of understanding. I love to learn in general and am a 
data fanatic.
